This device will help your inattentive brain stay on task using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). 

## Running
Currently awaiting review at [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org), and future work may include porting it to Chrome. For now, you can run it temporarily in Firefox following [these instructions](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/).

## Front of device

<ol>
  <li>The device's counter, which tracks your pomodoros. During a pomodoro, a green light will pulse to indicate that you are very hard at work. During a break, a red light will pulse. Each green/red pair is a round. The Long Break occurs in the fourth round; the counter resets thereafter.<br><br>

  <li>Controls the volume of all sound effects</li>
  <li>Displays countdown and, potentially, task (see 11)</li>
  <li>Flips the device over</li>
  <li>Resets the counter when held for three seconds</li>
